    "'''Q1. Explain Class and Object with respect to Object-Oriented Programming. Give a suitable example.\n",

    "              A class contains the blueprints or the prototype from which the objects are being created. \n",
    "              It is a logical entity that contains some attributes and methods. \n",
    "              \n",
    "              \n",
    "     Object :- An object is called an instance of a class. For example, suppose Bike is a class then we can create objects \n",
    "               like bike1, bike2, etc from the class. \n",

    "'''Q2. Name the four pillars of OOPs.\n",
    "Ans:- 1 Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the concept of bundling the data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on the data into \n",
    "     a single unit known as a class. It restricts direct access to some of the object's components and can prevent the accidental modification \n",
    "     of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2 Abstraction: Abstraction is the process of simplifying complex systems by modeling classes based on the essential properties and behaviors \n",
    "             they share. It involves hiding the complex reality while exposing only the relevant features of an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "3 Inheritance: Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a class to inherit properties and behaviors from another class. \n",
    "             \n",
    "4 Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class. \n",
    "              It enables a single interface to represent different types of objects and allows a single method to have different \n",
    "              implementations.'''"

    "'''Q4. Why self is used in OOPs?\n",
    "Ans:- The self keyword is used to represent an instance (object) of the given class. \n",

    "          cat1 = Cat('Andy', 2)\n",
    "          cat2 = Cat('Phoebe', 3)\n",
    "      the two Cat objects cat1 and cat2 have their own name and age attributes. If there was no self argument, the same class \n",

    "\n",
    "      self allows access to the attributes and methods of each object in python. \n",
    "      This allows each object to have its own attributes and methods. Thus, even long before creating these objects, we reference the \n",
